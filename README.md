# Learning Test Driven Development
Implemented a small 3 dimensional computational geometry library with an
emphasis on object oriented programming and test driven development.

Tested using Catch++ for C++.

Implemented runners for Continuous Integration.

Additional Testing was done which takes a Monte-Carlo approach to
testing the library for catching any underlying bugs.
